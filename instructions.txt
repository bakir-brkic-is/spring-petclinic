0. make sure you have reliable internet connection

1. Clone 'github.com/symphonygroup/devops-sa' repository, and navigate to '/Bakir/spring-petclinic' directory

2. If you do not have docker and docker-compose installed, and you are using Ubuntu, use 'install-docker-and-compose.sh' script to install them
2b. Script might not be executable by default, use $ sudo chmod +x install-docker-and-compose.sh this will make the script executable

3. if you have services that are using ports 8080 and/or 3306 stop them. If you have mySQL installed make sure to stop it by running $ service stop mysql this will release your 3306 port

4. run $ docker-compose up -d, your user might not be in the docker group, in that case run $ sudo docker-compose up -d, if you want to see the output from the containers omit -d flag

5. building of spring application is going to take about 20 minutes, make sure that nothings interrupts your internet connection since it has to download a lot

6. petclinic application should be available on http://localhost:8080/ data should be persistent between restarts since the mySQL-container will mount a pet-datavolume volume to store the DB in it.
